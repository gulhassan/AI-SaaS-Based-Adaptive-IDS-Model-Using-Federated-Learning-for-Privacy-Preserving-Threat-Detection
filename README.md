# AI SaaS-Based Adaptive IDS Model Using Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Threat Detection

This repository contains the complete implementation of my MSc dissertation project, which proposes a SaaS-based adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Federated Learning (FL). The aim is to detect threats while preserving user privacy across distributed environments.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Traditional IDS models often require centralized data aggregation, posing privacy risks. This project introduces a privacy-preserving IDS model leveraging:

- **Federated Learning (FL)**: Enables decentralized training without sharing raw data.
- **Adaptive IDS Model**: Dynamically adjusts to new attack patterns.
- **Multi-dataset Evaluation**: Tested on KDDCup99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- âœ… Support for both **KDD** and **UNSW-NB15** datasets  
- âœ… **Federated Learning server-client architecture** using Flower (`flwr`)  
- âœ… **TensorFlow-based training pipelines** for extensibility  
- âœ… Support for multiple clients (`client1.py`, `client2.py`, `client3.py`)  
- âœ… Preprocessing scripts for each dataset  
- âœ… Dashboard logging and performance tracking

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- Flower (FL framework)  
- Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn  
- Jupyter Notebook (for testing and visualization)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client1.py               # Standard FL client
â”œâ”€â”€ client1_TF.py            # TensorFlow-specific FL client
â”œâ”€â”€ client1_UNSW.py          # UNSW-specific client implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ client2.py               # Second client for FL
â”œâ”€â”€ client3.py               # Third client for FL
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py                # FL server logic
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.py             # Visualization & monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ balance_nsl_kdd.py       # Balancing script for KDD dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ nsl_kdd_preprocess.py    # Preprocessing KDD data
â”œâ”€â”€ unsw_nb15_preprocess.py  # Preprocessing UNSW-NB15 data
â”œâ”€â”€ KDDTrain+.txt            # Raw KDD training dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ KDDTest+.txt             # Raw KDD test dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv # Raw UNSW test data
â”œâ”€â”€ NUSW-NB15_features.csv   # UNSW feature definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ Server_FL_Aggregator.pem # PEM certificate (if using TLS)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # This file

ðŸ“Š Results Summary
âœ… Achieved high accuracy across multiple FL rounds with both datasets

âœ… Demonstrated resilience to data distribution variations

âœ… Showed effective privacy preservation without sacrificing performance

Figures, confusion matrices, and training accuracy graphs are included in the final dissertation document.
